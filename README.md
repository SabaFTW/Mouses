# GroundUp

> **A practical framework for understanding and working with AI systems**

GroundUp is a documentation system that helps humans develop effective strategies for working with AI language models. It provides structured frameworks for understanding AI capabilities, limitations, and interaction patterns.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

- **A taxonomy of AI capabilities** (what current systems can and cannot do)
- **Human usage strategies** (effective approaches for different tasks)
- **Interaction pattern library** (documented styles and their trade-offs)
- **Tool comparison framework** (objective analysis of different AI systems)
- **Practical examples** (real prompts, workflows, and techniques)

This is a **living documentation project** built by and for people who use AI systems professionally or extensively.

---

## 🚫 What This Is NOT

This framework does **NOT** claim or imply that:

- ❌ AI systems are conscious or sentient
- ❌ AI models have personalities or emotions
- ❌ AI systems are communicating with each other
- ❌ There are "living entities" inside language models
- ❌ Metaphorical frameworks represent actual AI experiences

**All organizational metaphors** (Pantheon, Gang, etc.) are **explicitly metaphorical** - they are naming conventions for categorizing interaction patterns, not claims about AI consciousness.
