# Research Path

Strategies for learning, literature review, synthesis, and knowledge exploration with AI.

---

## Core Techniques

### 1. Concept Explanation
Understand complex topics.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
"Explain [concept] to me:
- What is it?
- Why does it matter?
- How does it work?
- What are key examples?
- What are common misconceptions?
- Suggest further reading"
```

**Progressive depth:**
```
1st: "Explain [X] like I'm 10"
2nd: "Now explain it more technically"
3rd: "What are the cutting-edge developments?"
```

### 2. Literature Synthesis
Combine information from multiple sources.

**Workflow:**
```
1. Gather key papers/articles (YOU find them, not AI)
2. Provide summaries or excerpts to AI
3. Ask AI to identify:
   - Common themes
   - Contradictions
   - Gaps in research
   - Emerging patterns
4. Verify AI's synthesis against sources
```

### 3. Comparative Analysis
Understand differences between approaches.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
"Compare and contrast [A] vs [B]:

| Dimension | A | B |
|-----------|---|---|
| Core principle | | |
| Strengths | | |
| Weaknesses | | |
| Best use cases | | |
| Examples | | |
```

### 4. Knowledge Mapping
Build mental models of domains.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
"Help me build a knowledge map of [domain]:

1. What are the main sub-fields?
2. How do they relate to each other?
3. What are foundational concepts I must learn?
4. What's the learning path from beginner → expert?
5. What are key resources for each stage?"
```

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Verify sources (AI hallucinates citations!)
- ✅ Cross-reference facts
- ✅ Check publication dates
- ✅ Seek diverse perspectives
- ✅ Use AI to synthesize, not replace reading

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Trust AI-provided sources without verification
- ❌ Skip primary sources
- ❌ Accept summaries as complete understanding
- ❌ Ignore contradictory information
- ❌ Assume completeness

## Example Workflows

### Learning New Technology
```
1. "What is [technology] and why was it created?"
2. "What problems does it solve?"
3. "Show me a simple example"
4. "What are common pitfalls?"
5. "Compare it to [alternative]"
6. [Practice with actual code/projects]
```

### Literature Review
```
1. YOU find relevant papers (Google Scholar, etc.)
2. Read abstracts yourself
3. Provide key papers to AI for synthesis
4. AI identifies themes and gaps
5. YOU verify synthesis
6. Write review with AI assistance
7. Cite sources properly
```

### Competitive Analysis
```
1. Research competitors manually
2. Provide data to AI
3. AI generates comparison matrix
4. AI identifies differentiators
5. Verify findings
6. Analyze strategic implications
```

### Historical Research
```
1. Provide historical documents/context
2. AI helps identify patterns
3. AI suggests interpretations
4. YOU verify against primary sources
5. Synthesize findings
```

## Grounding Techniques

### Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
```
1. Build document collection
2. AI retrieves relevant sections
3. AI generates answer based on retrieved docs
4. Response includes citations
5. You verify citations are accurate
```

### Request Sources
```
"Provide 3 sources for each major claim.
Format: [Claim] - [Source]"

Then verify each source exists and supports the claim.
```

### Fact-Checking Protocol
```
For important facts:
1. AI makes claim
2. You ask: "How confident are you? What could be wrong?"
3. AI provides uncertainty estimate
4. You verify independently
```

## Common Pitfalls

```
❌ Trusting AI-invented citations
❌ Skipping source verification
❌ Accepting summaries without reading originals
❌ Missing important context
❌ Assuming comprehensiveness
❌ Not checking training data cutoff
```
