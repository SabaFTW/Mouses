# Creative Path

Strategies for writing, brainstorming, ideation, and creative collaboration with AI.

---

## Core Techniques

### 1. Brainstorming
Generate diverse ideas quickly.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
"I need ideas for [goal/project].

Generate 20 ideas across different approaches:
- 5 conventional ideas
- 5 creative twists
- 5 unconventional ideas
- 5 wild/experimental ideas

For each, include a one-sentence description."
```

### 2. Iterative Drafting
Progressively refine content.

**Workflow:**
```
1st prompt: "Write a rough draft about [topic]"
2nd prompt: "Make it more [specific quality]"
3rd prompt: "Add concrete examples"
4th prompt: "Polish the introduction"
[Final]: Human editing pass
```

### 3. Style Matching
Mimic specific voices or formats.

**Prompt pattern:**
```
"Here are 3 examples of my writing style:

[Example 1]
[Example 2]
[Example 3]

Now write about [topic] in this same style."
```

### 4. Creative Constraints
Use limitations to drive creativity.

**Examples:**
```
"Write a product description using only one-syllable words"
"Explain [concept] as a fairy tale"
"Describe [thing] without using [common words]"
```
