## Choosing Your Path

### By Task Type

**Need to understand something?** → Research Path
**Need to create something?** → Creative Path
**Need to analyze something?** → Analytical Path
**Need to automate something?** → Automation Path

### By Skill Level

**Beginner:** Start with Creative or Research paths
**Intermediate:** Try Analytical path
**Advanced:** Explore Automation path

### By Risk Tolerance

**Low-stakes:** Any path works
**Medium-stakes:** Analytical or Research (more verification)
**High-stakes:** Automation with extensive testing, human oversight

## Path Combinations

Most real-world workflows combine multiple paths:

**Content Creation Workflow:**
```
1. Research: Gather information
2. Creative: Draft content
3. Analytical: Review and refine
4. Automation: Format and publish
```

**Product Development:**
```
1. Analytical: Understand problem space
2. Research: Survey existing solutions
3. Creative: Brainstorm approaches
4. Automation: Build and deploy
```

**Data Science Project:**
```
1. Research: Literature review
2. Analytical: Data exploration
3. Automation: Pipeline building
4. Creative: Visualization and reporting
```
