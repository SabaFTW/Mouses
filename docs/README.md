# GroundUp Documentation

Welcome to the GroundUp documentation. This framework helps you understand AI capabilities and develop effective strategies for working with AI systems.

## Navigation

### 📊 [Rows - AI Capability Dimensions](rows/)
Technical understanding of what AI systems can and cannot do:
- [Language Modeling](rows/language-modeling.md) - Text generation, understanding, and translation
- [Tool Use](rows/tool-use.md) - Function calling, API integration, and automation
- [Reasoning](rows/reasoning.md) - Planning, problem-solving, and logical inference
- [Failure Modes](rows/failure-modes.md) - Common errors and limitations

### 🛤️ [Paths - Human Usage Strategies](paths/)
Practical approaches for different types of tasks:
- [Analytical](paths/analytical.md) - Research, data analysis, and investigation
- [Creative](paths/creative.md) - Writing, brainstorming, and ideation
- [Automation](paths/automation.md) - Workflows, scripts, and integration
- [Research](paths/research.md) - Literature review, synthesis, and exploration

### 🏛️ [Pantheon - Interaction Style Taxonomy](pantheon/)
**Metaphorical framework** for categorizing interaction patterns (NOT claims about AI consciousness)

### 🤝 [Gang - AI Tool Comparison](gang/)
Objective comparison of different AI systems and their interfaces

### 📚 Additional Resources
- [Limits](limits.md) - What AI can't or shouldn't do
- [Ethics](ethics.md) - Ethical considerations when working with AI
- [Glossary](glossary.md) - Key terms and definitions
